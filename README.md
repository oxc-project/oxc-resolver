# Oxc Resolver

Rust port of [enhanced-resolve].

- Released on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/oxc_resolver) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxc-resolver).
- Implements the [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#resolution-algorithm) and [CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#all-together) module resolution algorithm specification.
- Built-in [tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin]
  - support extending tsconfig defined in `tsconfig.extends`
  - support paths alias defined in `tsconfig.compilerOptions.paths`
  - support project references defined `tsconfig.references`
  - support [template variable ${configDir} for substitution of config files directory path](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/58042)
- Supports in-memory file system via the `FileSystem` trait.
- Contains `tracing` instrumentation.

## Usage

### npm package

See index.d.ts for `resolveSync` and `ResolverFactory` API.

Quick example:

```javascript
import assert from 'assert';
import path from 'path';
import resolve, { ResolverFactory } from './index.js';

// `resolve`
assert(resolve.sync(process.cwd(), './index.js').path, path.join(cwd, 'index.js'));

// `ResolverFactory`
const resolver = new ResolverFactory();
assert(resolver.sync(process.cwd(), './index.js').path, path.join(cwd, 'index.js'));
```

#### Supports WASM

See https://stackblitz.com/edit/oxc-resolver for usage example.

### Rust

See [docs.rs/oxc_resolver](https://docs.rs/oxc_resolver/latest/oxc_resolver).

### [Yarn Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp)

- For node.js, yarn pnp should work without any configuration, given the following conditions:
  - the program is called with the `yarn` command, where the value [`process.versions.pnp`](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnpapi#processversionspnp) is set.
  - `.pnp.cjs` manifest file exists in the closest directory, searched from the current working directory,
  - no multi-project setup, per second bullet point in [FIND_PNP_MANIFEST](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec#find_pnp_manifest)

## Terminology

### `directory`

An **absolute** path to a directory where the specifier is resolved against.

For CommonJS modules, it is the `__dirname` variable that contains the absolute path to the folder containing current module.

For ECMAScript modules, it is the value of `import.meta.url`.

Behavior is undefined when given a path to a file.

### `specifier`

The string passed to `require` or `import`, i.e. `require("specifier")` or `import "specifier"`

## Errors and Trouble Shooting

- `Error: Package subpath '.' is not defined by "exports" in` - occurs when resolving without `conditionNames`.

## Configuration

The following usages apply to both Rust and Node.js; the code snippets are written in JavaScript.

To handle the `exports` field in `package.json`, ESM and CJS need to be differentiated.

### ESM

Per [ESM Resolution algorithm](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#resolution-and-loading-algorithm)

> defaultConditions is the conditional environment name array, ["node", "import"].

This means when the caller is an ESM import (`import "module"`), resolve options should be

```javascript
{
  "conditionNames": ["node", "import"]
}
```

### CJS

Per [CJS Resolution algorithm](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#all-together)

> LOAD_PACKAGE_EXPORTS(X, DIR)
>
> 5. let MATCH = PACKAGE_EXPORTS_RESOLVE(pathToFileURL(DIR/NAME), "." + SUBPATH,
>    `package.json` "exports", ["node", "require"]) defined in the ESM resolver.

This means when the caller is a CJS require (`require("module")`), resolve options should be

```javascript
{
  "conditionNames": ["node", "require"]
}
```

### Cache

To support both CJS and ESM with the same cache:

```javascript
const esmResolver = new ResolverFactory({
  conditionNames: ['node', 'import'],
});

const cjsResolver = esmResolver.cloneWithOptions({
  conditionNames: ['node', 'require'],
});
```

### Browser Field

From this [non-standard spec](https://github.com/defunctzombie/package-browser-field-spec):

> The `browser` field is provided to JavaScript bundlers or component tools when packaging modules for client side use.

The option is

```javascript
{
  "aliasFields": ["browser"]
}
```

### Main Field

```javascript
{
  "mainFields": ["module", "main"]
}
```

Quoting esbuild's documentation:

- `main` - This is [the standard field](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#main) for all packages that are meant to be used with node. The name main is hard-coded in to node's module resolution logic itself. Because it's intended for use with node, it's reasonable to expect that the file path in this field is a CommonJS-style module.
- `module` - This field came from a [proposal](https://github.com/dherman/defense-of-dot-js/blob/f31319be735b21739756b87d551f6711bd7aa283/proposal.md) for how to integrate ECMAScript modules into node. Because of this, it's reasonable to expect that the file path in this field is an ECMAScript-style module. This proposal wasn't adopted by node (node uses "type": "module" instead) but it was adopted by major bundlers because ECMAScript-style modules lead to better tree shaking, or dead code removal.
- `browser` - This field came from a [proposal](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901/49493836fb873ddaa4b8a7aa0ef2352119f69211) that allows bundlers to replace node-specific files or modules with their browser-friendly versions. It lets you specify an alternate browser-specific entry point. Note that it is possible for a package to use both the browser and module field together (see the note below).

## Options

The following options are aligned with [enhanced-resolve], and is implemented for Rust crate usage.

See [index.d.ts](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc-resolver/blob/main/napi/index.d.ts) for Node.js usage.

## Debugging

The following environment variable emits tracing information for the `oxc_resolver::resolve` function.

e.g.

```
2024-06-11T07:12:20.003537Z DEBUG oxc_resolver: options: ResolveOptions { ... }, path: "...", specifier: "...", ret: "..."
    at /path/to/oxc_resolver-1.8.1/src/lib.rs:212
    in oxc_resolver::resolve with path: "...", specifier: "..."
```

The input values are `options`, `path` and `specifier`, the returned value is `ret`.

### NAPI

```
OXC_LOG=DEBUG your_program
